    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We recently released a major upgrade to Canvas&rsquo;s calendar. Although the primary objective was adding an agenda view and other accessibility tools, we also took the opportunity to update its visual design, including the color coding that links events and calendars. We&rsquo;ve released this new color code generator as a Bower package at <a href="https://github.com/instructure/color-slicer">github/instructure/color-slicer</a>. Here&rsquo;s why we switched.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Our old color coding system was pretty simple: we had a list of ten hues, and we assigned them to calendars in order. The drawbacks were that colors would repeat after ten calendars and that the colors used weren&rsquo;t very appealing.</p>

<p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/6lBEr3V.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Another system we considered was <a href="https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/blob/stable/app/coffeescripts/util/contextColors.coffee">our hash-based color generator</a>, which creates a color based on an object name or ID. This would avoid repetition, but unlucky users could end up with three slightly different shades of green for their three courses.</p>

<p>For the new system, then, we had three goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Produce colors that look nice and are accessibly readable for text.</li>
<li>Allow an unlimited number of colors without repetition.</li>
<li>Keep colors visually distinct, especially for short lists.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Text colors</h2>

<p>The simplest way to generate bright colors would be use HSV and to vary the hue while using 100% saturation and value. For text on a white background, though, this makes yellows almost invisible:</p>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/3KX8d/1/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kk4ntIE.png" /></a></p>

<p>Instead, we use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space">Lab color space</a>, which adjusts for human sensitivity to green, providing a better measurement of lightness and more evenly distributed hues. This not only looks better, but also helps users with limited vision by meeting <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WCAG AA contrast guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/G9Qmm/1/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/V5jstLt.png?1" /></a></p>

<h2>Spacing</h2>

<p>An easy way to space the colors would be to divide the hue circle by the number of calendars. We didn&rsquo;t want all of the colors to change whenever a user added a course, though; we wanted to use the same colors for the first three calendars whether there were three or thirty total. To accomplish this, we <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/UqSS3/6/">progressively divide each gap in half</a>: first we use 0°, then 180°, then 90°, then 270°, then 45°, and so on. This way, your first few calendars are always very visually distinct.</p>

<p>Formally, this is essentially an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_problem">Thomson problem</a>. We&rsquo;re lucky to only have to solve the one-dimensional version, but the same basic idea could certainly be used to vary hue and value simultaneously if you wanted to generate many distinct colors and didn&rsquo;t care about legibility. The <a href="http://sitemason.vanderbilt.edu/page/hmbADS">spiral point heuristic</a> would probably work well&mdash;we&rsquo;d love to see someone send us a pull request.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re always refining our user experience, but we&rsquo;re happy with the look of our new colors.</p>

<p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/GLSrwyh.png?1" alt="" /></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve released <a href="https://github.com/instructure/color-slicer">color-slicer</a> in UMD format under an MIT license, so it should be easy to add to your projects. I hope you&rsquo;ll find it useful. My favorite part of working at Instructure&mdash;better than weekly lunch&mdash;is spending most of my time crafting code that we give back to the community. Let us know what you think.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Instructure, we&rsquo;re moving more and more of our app to the client with technologies like <a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember.js</a>. While it and other JavaScript frameworks have made this transition easier, they&rsquo;ve also introduced new challenges around keeping our content accessible.</p>

<p>The old advice we&rsquo;ve all heard about using semantic markup, headers, and <code>alt</code> attributes on <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code> tags is still true, but it doesn&rsquo;t address how we can best develop accessible content in a rich client application. Despite rumors to the contrary, rich content <em>can</em> be accessible if we pay attention to a few basics.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Getting started with accessibility</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.</p><footer><strong>W3 <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a few definitions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Web content is accessible when it usable by persons with disabilities. While this includes users of screen readers, it also includes persons with cognitive and other disabilities.</li>
<li><strong>WAI-ARIA</strong>: A suite of technologies designed to make rich Internet applications accessible to users with disabilities.</li>
</ul>


<p>Authoring accessible rich content most often means (1) using WAI-ARIA attributes such as <code>role</code> and <code>aria-expanded</code> to mark-up content in a machine-parseable way; (2) ensuring that all content is keyboard navigable; and (3) managing page focus.</p>

<p>So what does all of this mean when you&rsquo;re developing widgets? Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example of a button set component.</p>

<h2>Building a button set</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to build an accessible <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups">button set</a> using Twitter&rsquo;s Bootstrap styles and jQuery.</p>

<p>Our button set is going to work like a filter, so users can only select one button at a time. This means it&rsquo;s like a radio button. Watch how we can use aria roles and attributes to convey that behavior to non-sighted users:</p>

<p>```html</p>

<div class="btn-group" role="radiogroup">
  <button type="button"
          class="btn btn-default active"
          role="radio"
          aria-checked="true">Open</button>
  <button type="button"
          class="btn btn-default"
          role="radio"
          aria-checked="false">Closed</button>
</div>


<p>```</p>

<p>First, notice that we didn&rsquo;t change Twitter&rsquo;s recommended button set markup &mdash; we only augmented it with the <code>role</code> attributes and an <code>aria-checked</code> attribute. The <code>role</code> attribute describes the component&rsquo;s behavior to screen readers, and <code>aria-checked</code> attribute notifies users of the current option in the same way that the <code>active</code> class does for sighted users.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the JavaScript to make this happen:</p>

<p>```javascript
$.fn.buttonset = function() {
  $(this).on(&lsquo;click&rsquo;, function(e) {</p>

<pre><code>var $target = $(this);

$target.siblings()
  .removeClass('active')
  .attr('aria-checked', false);

$target
  .addClass('active')
  .attr('aria-checked', true);
</code></pre>

<p>  });
};</p>

<p>// usage
$(&lsquo;.btn-group .btn&rsquo;).buttonset();
```</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re defining this as a jQuery plugin, we could have just as easily made an Ember component, an Angular directive, or a Backbone view.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve found that this level is often the best place for dealing with accessibility. By handling accessibility details in our reusable widgets and libraries we can code it once and benefit across our stack. New engineers can immediately start writing accessible code, and all engineers benefit from quick, accessible implementations of common patterns.</p>

<p>In this case, our code is almost all standard jQuery. This solution doesn&rsquo;t require us to manage focus or worry about keyboard navigation because buttons are already in the tab order, but often widget markup will need a <code>tabindex=-1</code> attribute and calls like <code>$('.item').focus()</code> to ensure that screen reader users aren&rsquo;t lost on the page.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s our component in action (it&rsquo;s easier to test with a screen reader if you pop out this example into its own page first):</p>

<p><a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/OBoqALa/1/embed?output">JS Bin</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script></p>

<h2>Testing accessibility</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on a Mac, you already have the software you need to get started testing for accessibility. OSX ships with a screen reader, VoiceOver, that can be enabled in your System Preferences and activated by pressing Cmd-F5.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on Windows, take a look at the free <a href="http://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA</a> or, if you&rsquo;re doing professional development, the more widely used <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/jaws-product-page.asp">JAWS</a>.</p>

<p>To ensure that everything we write is accessible, we test all new commits in VoiceOver and JAWS as well as in our supported browsers before merging to master. And while giving accessibility top priority alongside visual fidelity and layout initially slowed us down, we&rsquo;ve long since adjusted and now have  better code and a better product.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Developing with accessibility in mind has been a great experience at Instructure. By starting with an eye to accessibility we&rsquo;ve been able to leverage WAI-ARIA tools to create rich, accessible content in an unobtrusive way.</p>

<h3>Additional resources</h3>

<p>To learn more about accessibility, take a look at the W3&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices">Authoring Practices</a> document. It covers additional topics like keyboard shortcuts, managing focus, and properly labeling content. The Illinois Center of Information Technology and Web Accessibility also have a great <a href="http://test.cita.uiuc.edu/aria/">collection of accessibility examples</a>.</p>
