Each month, [nerds unite](http://www.meetup.com/EmberJS-SLC/) at the Instructure building to share their knowledge on [Ember](http://www.emberjs.com). This month we had two presentations by a couple of Instructure engineers. Here are the videos and accompanying slides/code.

## Ember Run Loop

Jason Madsen ([@jason_madsen](https://twitter.com/jason_madsen)) discussed the what, why, and how of the Ember Run Loop. Learn how Ember manages the run loop for you, and cases where you will want to manage the run loop. Here's a hint: speed and testing.

## Testing Your Ember Application using TDD

Eric Berry ([@cavneb](https://twitter.com/cavneb)) presented on how to "Test Drive" your Ember applications. Eric starts from scratch and walks through different types of tests that can be written. By the end, you will have a much better understanding of how to test your Ember application.
